    <h2><center>Common Automobile Problems</center></h1>
      <h3 id="rotors">Bad Brake Pads or Rotors</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: Unbearable squeaking and squealing</strong></p>
        <p>Once you've got the car jacked up and the tire removed, you're ready to take off the caliper and remove the actual pads. You'll first want to remove the slide pins, which hold the caliper in place. Once these are out, you'll be able to separate the caliper, which will only be hanging by the brake line, then. Don't let it rest only on this line, put it on something or use something to hold it up. You'll be able to remove the actual pads now, which, if the car was squealing, will be heavily worn down.</p>
        <P>From here, you'll need a c-clamp, in order to compress the piston back down into the caliper. Be careful with this, and you don't want to push the seal back in unevenly. While everything is apart, this is also a great time to check to see if the worn pads did any damage to the rotors. If you run your finger across the rotor, and you feel deep grooves or uneven and warped surfaces, you're going to want to replace the rotors, as well. Now you're ready to slide the pads back across the rotors, re-insert the brake caliper over the pads and tighten up the pins. The final thing you want to do is check your brake fluid. Not so hard, right?</p>
      <h3 id="alternator">Dead Alternator</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: Your car won't turn over, and the gadgets inside don't even light up</strong></p>
        <p>People see something electrical and thing it's automatically complicated. That couldn't be further from the truth. This is going to sound extremely simple, and that's because it is. Remove the electrical connections (there should be power wires and a harness connector), unbolt the brackets, and use the built-in tensioner to free the serpentine belt. That's it. Put the new one back in the way it came out, reconnect the wires, and boom, fire her up.</p>
      <h3 id="battery">Dead Battery</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: Your car won't start</strong></p>
        <p>If you don't have a tester or charger at your house, places like Autozone will check it for free to make sure the battery is actually the problem and not the starter or alternator. If there's any corrosion, clean that off with a metal brush. Unbolt the negative terminal first, then the positive. There might also be a ground wire that you'll need to take off. Then, put the new one in. It's that simple.</p>
      <h3 id="faultyplugs">Faulty Spark Plugs</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: Hard starts or rough idles</strong></p>
        <p>Spark plugs, well, spark the combustion in your engine. If the spark plugs are all gunked up or misfiring, the engine won't be running and starting properly. This is where the deep sockets come into play (even more so, if they're magnetic). Pop off the covers, unscrew those puppies, and put some new, clean ones in there. Unless the engine is extremely far back in the bay to the point where you can't access the plugs without a lot more work, this is something you can do relatively easily.</p>
      <h3 id="tire">Flat Tire</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: Your car is tilting, and there is a loud thumping noise</strong></p>
        <p>If you're not strong enough, that's one thing, but this is something any capable human being with common sense should be able to figure out. In your trunk, you have a spare tire. Within that spare tire is usually a small car jack with a built-in lever and lug nut ratchet. Put the jack on a stable part of the frame (no plastic pieces!), pump up the car, remove the lug nuts and put the donut on. Just make sure you adequately tighten the nuts and slowly bring down the jack.</p>
      <h3 id="out">Head or Tail Lights Out</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: The blinkers blink faster, or you know, you won't see it lighting up</strong></p>
        <p>If you don't want to figure it out yourself, all you have to do is ask which type of bulb you need, based on which make or model you have. If you have a basic vehicle, you DO NOT need he ultra premium lights. Once you have the bulbs, you can usually pop lights out of the back of the housing, and (with the car turned off), unplug the old bulb. Slide the new one in, and you're good to go. Sometimes, annoying plastic covering will make this more difficult, but don't let it frustrate you.</p> 
      <h3 id="radiator">Leaky Radiator</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: You can't see your antifreeze, when you take off the cap (see: puddle under your car)</strong></p>
        <p>When your radiator is leaking, it's a better idea just to replace the entire thing, rather than trying to patch it up with welding or sealant. It's only delaying the inevitable. Start by jacking up the car and removing the drain bolt at the bottom of the radiator to remove all coolant. While that's going on, you can start removing the overflow tank, unplugging the cooling fans, removing the top radiator hose, and taking off the top brackets that help hold the radiator in place. If there's room, you can remove the fans right there, or you can wait to remove them after you pull it all out in one big package. If you have an automatic car, you'll also have to remove the transmission cooling line. From there, slide the new radiator in and swap all the tubes and rubber pieces. Finally, fill the car with either premixed fluid or a 50-50 mixture of antifreeze and water.</p>
      <h3 id="caps">Loose Fuel Caps</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 9.28% | Average Cost: 80 cents</strong></p>
        <p>A leading reason the pesky “check engine” light turns on, loose or missing gas caps cost very little to fix but can cause car owners tons of money if left unattended, since the problem can result in a 0.5% decrease in gas mileage. CarMD estimates that lost, damaged or missing gas caps cause 147 million gallons of gas to evaporate every year.</p>
      <h3 id="change">Oil Change</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: You should be doing this every 3,000-5,000 miles, based on the age of your car and the type of oil you use</strong></p>
        <p>There are four things you need to know before changing your oil: what type of oil and oil fiter you need (owner's manual or books at the auto shop), where the oil pan bolt is, where the oil filter is, and how much oil your engine holds. When you've got that down, there are three basic steps: Loosen the bolt and drain the old oil, replace the oil filter, and refill the engine with new oil after tightening the bolt back up. Make sure you put a little bit of oil in the filter and lubricate the rubber ring with oil.</p>
      <h3 id="alarm">Removing Aftermarket Alarm</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 1.96% | Average Cost: $75.85</strong></p>
        <p>This is a repair car owners bring on themselves when they attempt to install after-market alarms (or other hands-free devices, car stereos, etc.) on their own.
        “When owners add things to their vehicles, they tap into circuits for convenience,” Jacobsen explains. “But that takes power away from something else” and can potentially lead other systems to fail.</p>
      <h3 id="converter">Replacing Catalytic Converter</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 6.40% | Average Cost: $1,001.74</strong></p>
        <p>According to Jacobsen, the costliest repair in the top 10 should never have made the list to begin with. This is because catalytic converters, which are responsible for controlling a vehicle’s emission system, typically only fail when a smaller, related part – such as a spark plug or fuel injector – is ignored for too long. “It’s a case where not taking care of something small leads to a big repair with a hefty price tag,” he says.</p>
      <h3 id="temperaturesensor">Replacing Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 2.65% | Average Cost: $132.62</strong></p>
        <p>Problems with the engine coolant temperature sensor, a sensor that does exactly what its name suggests, was actually only the ninth most common repair when CarMD analyzed its data over a 14-year timespan.</p>
      <h3 id="valve">Replacing Exhaust Gas Recirculation valve</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 2.85% | Average Cost: $288.19</strong></p>
        <p>Problems with the exhaust gas recirculation valve, a part of the emissions system responsible for recirculating a portion of a car’s exhaust through the engine a second time, was actually the fourth leading cause of vehicle failure in a separate list compiled by CarMD.</p>
      <h3 id="coils">Replacing Ignition Coils</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 2.58% | Average Cost: $213.16</strong></p>
        <p>Ignition coils essentially tell the spark plugs when to do their job, and ignoring a problem with them can do serious damage to your car’s entire ignition system. Determining whether or not there is problem with the ignition coil typically involves going through a diagnostic test.</p>
      <h3 id="gaskets">Replacing Intake Manifold Gaskets</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 2.05% | Average Cost: $326.74</strong></p>
        <p>Leaks in the intake manifold gasket, which prevent leakage of air or the mixture of air and fuel between metal engine parts, can also contribute to larger problems with a car’s fuel economy, emissions and engine performance.</p> 
      <h3 id="flowsensor">Replacing Mass Air Flow Sensor</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 4.36% | Average Cost: $376.69</strong></p>
        <p>Jacobsen says repairs to the mass air flow sensor, which measures the amount of air supplied to the engine and determines how much fuel should be delivered to it, also typically indicates a preventive maintenance issue. “It stems from not replacing your air filters,” he says, estimating that doing so would cost around $25 compared to the $400 you’re likely to shell out for a new sensor.</p>
      <h3 id="oxygensensor">Replacing Oxygen Sensor</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 9.43% | Average Cost: $238.71</strong></p>
        <p>According to Jacobsen, the oxygen sensor, which monitors the amount of unburned oxygen in the exhaust and tells the car’s computer when there is either too much or not enough gas in the tank, should really be a do-it-yourself repair. However, he says, manufacturers have increasingly taken to strategically placing a special cover over the sensor that requires a special tool – conveniently on hand at most dealerships – to open. “They make it much more difficult to get at,” Jacobsen says, and cost owners a few hundred dollars in the process.</p>
      <h3 id="replaceplugs">Replacing Spark Plugs</h3>
        <p><strong>Percent of Fixes in 2010: 3.71% | Average Cost: $311.40</strong></p>
        <p>Another small part that can cause big problems is the spark plug, which is responsible for igniting fuel in the cylinders. According to CarMD, replacing a spark plug on your own can cost less than $10. However, because faulty spark plugs can reduce your gas mileage or melt your car’s significantly more expensive catalytic converter, having them replaced by a certified mechanic may actually be worth the added expense.</p>
      <h3 id="mirrior">Side-View Mirror</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: Your blind spot just got a lot bigger</strong></p>
        <p>This one is a little hard to explain without showing you a diagram, so we dug up the image above to show you how minimal the work is for replacing a side-view mirror. We see hanging mirrors, broken mirrors, makeup replacement mirrors, or no mirror at all often. In reality, we should never see it, considering how easy they are to replace on our own.</p>
      <h3 id="belts">Squeaky Belts</h3>
        <p><strong>Symptoms: An intensly annoying squeak every two seconds, cracks in the belts</strong></p>
        <p>A bad belt will usually be pretty easy to spot. You'll see the wear starting to fray and crack. Before you start ripping off your current belt, make sure you have a belt diagram or draw a belt diagram. You're going to want to know the path the belt takes. Once you've got this down, use a ratchet to loosen the tension arm, freeing the belt. With the pulleys exposed, make sure there is no excess rubber, grime or oil that would hasten belt disintegration. Use your diagram to reroute the new belt, lock up the tension arm, and you're ready to go.</p>
